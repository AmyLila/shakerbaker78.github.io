		<h1>Fear Of Missing Out?</h1>
		<h3>I am here to help you clear out the drudgery and create meaningful experiences with your family. </h3>
		<p>Hi, I’m Amy, a busy student, and mom of four. I’m honored that you stopped by. I have spent years studying families in both an academic setting and in my home. I have learned that creating meaningful traditions and rituals leads to a more peaceful and happy home. I’m here to share my expertise with you so that you can create wonderful memories and experiences with your family that you all will treasure for a lifetime.</p>
		<p>With all the serious issues that families face today, you might wonder why I'm only focusing on traditions and rituals. There are two reasons for this. The first is that what we focus on tends to go, so if we are focusing on creating happy memories the overall happiness in our homes will grow. The second reason has to do with family culture. One of the things that strengthens families is a strong family identity or sense of unity. Traditions and rituals are tools we can use to help create that family identity.  When we intentionally create fun traditions they become a part of our family culture and enhance our unity and joy. </p>
