            <h4>Target Audience</h4>
            <p>My target audience is moms who live in or are visiting Eastern Idaho and want to enjoy the outdoors but aren’t hard core outdoor enthusiasts.</p>
            <p>They are women aged 25-55 who are part of a family. They make enough money to be able to enjoy leisure time with their family. About 45,000-70,000 a year.</p>

            <h4>Two Personas</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Sarah is 38 year old kindergarten teacher with a master’s degree in education. She earns around 60,000 a year. She is married with two boys ages 12 and 8. She enjoys hiking and fishing with her family and likes to feel prepared when she ventures outside. She also likes to know what the weather will be like during the hours she is teaching so she can plan outdoor activities with her class appropriately. She spend time on a computer with a large screen and generally checks the weather on that computer before checking her work email. </p></li>
            <li><p>Claudia is a 55 year old massage therapist. She enjoys yoga, walking her dogs, golf, and hiking. She is single but has 3 children and two grandchildren. She loves to take her grandkids and dogs to the park to play. She makes 49,000 a year. She does not own a computer so would only view the site on her phone or tablet.</p></li>
